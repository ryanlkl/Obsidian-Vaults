# Problem
Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

**Note:**
- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
## Examples
**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = 
[ ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"] ]
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**
**Input:** board = 
[ ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"] ]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Same as Example 1, except with the **5** in the top left corner being modified to **8**. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
## Constraints
- `board.length == 9`
- `board[i].length == 9`
- `board[i][j]` is a digit `1-9` or `'.'`.
# Intuition
- Each row, column and 3x3 must be unique so we use sets
# Approach
1. Initialise 3 arrays of 9 sets for rows, columns and 3x3 grids
2. Loop through each row
3. Loop through each column
4. Check to see if value is a number
5. If it is a number, check if it's in the corresponding row, column or box set
6. If it is in there, return False
7. If it isn't, add the value to the sets
8. Repeat for every square
9. If the loop terminates, return True

```Python
def isValidSudoku(board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
	rows = [set() for _ in range(9)]
	cols = [set() for _ in range(9)]
	box = [set() for _ in range(9)]

	for row in range(9):
		for col in range(9):
		value = board[row][col]
			if value != ".":
				if value in rows[row] or value in cols[col] or value in box[(row//3) * 3 + (col//3)]:
					return False
				rows[row].add(value)
				cols[col].add(value)
				box[(row//3) * 3 + (col//3)].add(value)
	return True
