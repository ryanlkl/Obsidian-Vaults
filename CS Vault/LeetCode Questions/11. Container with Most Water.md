You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.
## Examples
**Example 1:**
![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg)

**Input:** height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
**Output:** 49
**Explanation:** The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** height = [1,1]
**Output:** 1
## Constraints
- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 104`
# Intuition
- By moving the smaller side, we always ensure that we have a possible larger height
# Approach
1. Initialise a max area variable and 2 pointers for the start and end of the array
2. calculate the area of the rectangle using the minimum value as the height
3. Update the maximum area if needed
4. Move the smaller side inwards
# Complexity
- Time complexity:
- Space complexity:
# Code
```Python
def maxArea(height: List[int]) -> int:
	max_area = 0
	i,j = 0,len(height) - 1
	while i < j:
		area = (j - i) * min(height[i],height[j])
		max_area = max(max_area,area)
		if height[i] < height[j]:
			i += 1
		else:
			j -= 1
	return max_area
```
