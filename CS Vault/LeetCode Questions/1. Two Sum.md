# [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
Tags: [[Arrays]], [[Hash Tables]]
### Difficulty: **Easy**
# Problem
## Description
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.
### Constraints
- `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `-109 <= target <= 109`
- **Only one valid answer exists.**
## Examples
**Example 1:**
**Input:** nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
**Output:** [0,1]
**Explanation:** Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

**Example 2:**
**Input:** nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
**Output:** [1,2]

**Example 3:**
**Input:** nums = [3,3], target = 6
**Output:** [0,1]
## Solution
### Approach
1. Create an empty hash table to store elements and indices
2. Iterate through array of number from left to right
3. Check if the complement to target-nums[i] has already been seen in the array, if it does, that is the solution
4. If it doesn't, add the current element and index to the hash table
5. Repeat steps 2-5 until the solution is found

### Code
``` Python
def twoSum(nums, target):
	seen = {} # Create empty hash table

	for i,n in enumerate(nums): # Loops through indices and values
		if target - n in seen: # Check for complement
			return [seen[target-n], i]
		seen[n] = i

print(twoSum([1,3,4,5,2,6,7,3,7,3,5,6],10))
```
### Complexity
**Time complexity**: O(n) as hash table lookup takes constant time and only one pass through the array is needed
