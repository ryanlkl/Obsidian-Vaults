# Problem
Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence._

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.
## Examples
**Example 1:**
**Input:** nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Therefore its length is 4.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
**Output:** 9
## Constraints
- `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
