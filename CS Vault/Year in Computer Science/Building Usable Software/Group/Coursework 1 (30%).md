# Description
**Select one** from the following.
## 1. Net Zero
#### Aims
- Aiming for 100% greenhouse emissions and net zero by 2050 to comply with 2008 Climate Change Act
- Net Zero strategy sets out plans to reduce emissions and decarbonise all sectors from UK economy (from transport to agriculture):
	- Reduce energy use
	- Improve home insulation and energy efficiency
	- Switch to electric vehicles
	- Replace central heating with gas system such as heat pumps
	- Incentives for farmers to use low-carbon farming methods
#### Examples
##### Steps of action
- Improvement in public transport and more electric cars will reduce road pollution
- Increase the number of trees to improve air quality and protect nature whilst expanding renewable energy sector (greater energy security)
##### Applications
- **Recycling locator**: An app that helps users find the nearest recycling centres or drop-off points based on the type of items they want to recycle
- **Carbon Footprint Tracker**: A web or mobile application that allows users to input daily activities and calculate their carbon footprint and tips to reduce it
- **Eco-gaming**: An application that sets daily or weekly sustainability challenges for users. Could include features like earning points for sustainable action which can be redeemed for digital badges or real-world rewards
- **Digital Thrift Store**: An application where pre-owned items can be bought, sold or swapped which promotes resources and reduces new purchases
## 2. Remote Health Monitoring
#### Aims
- Combat the risk to the exponential growth of elderly population in the UK
- Elderly people are at the highest risk of adverse outcomes such as falls, disability, admissions to hospital and long-term care.
- Require continuous monitoring of their vital signs such as:
	- temperature
	- blood pressure
	- heart rate
- Increase quality of health and social care
- Optimise use of human, financial and environmental resources
#### Examples
- **Elderly Care Companion**: Application designed for the elderly to aid with medication reminders, daily task scheduling and providing easy access to emergency contacts
- **Exercise and Physiotherapy Guide**: Platform that provides video demonstrations of exercises or physiotherapy routines prescribed by healthcare professionals
- **Dietary Log and Analysis**: Application that allows users to log their daily food intake and receive an analysis based on their nutritional guidelines of the NHS. Can suggest healthier alternatives or recipes
- **Telehealth Diagnosis**: Web or mobile application to assist patients in pre-diagnosing symptoms based on their vital signs, medical images, prescriptions and offer immediate teleconsultations with healthcare professionals depending on need.

# Tasks
## Requirements Engineering
#### A1. Describe the Proposed System (10%)
- State assumptions about the scope of the system, objectives, challenges, key features/services and stakeholders. **Minimum 500, Maximum 800 words**
	- 5 features to consider *without including log-in or sign-up pages*
#### A2. State the Functional Requirements of the Proposed System (16.6%)
- Use sensible phrasing, grouping (based on features/services) and prioritisation
	- **25** functional requirements (5 each?)
#### A3. State the Non-Functional Requirements of the Proposed System (16.6%)
- Should include product requirements (Availability, Performance, Maintainability, etc.)
- Should include organisational requirements (e.g. based on NHS or legislation)
- Include **at least 15** non-functional requirements
	- Using MoSCoW criteria to prioritise requirements
## Software Specification, Analysis, and Design using UML
