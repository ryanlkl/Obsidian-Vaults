# Overview

From the official documentation:

A **dependency manager** and **packaging** tool for Python. It allows you to declare libraries the project depends on and manages them for you. It also offers a lockfile to ensure repeatable installs, and can build your project for distribution

> [!DANGER]
> Poetry should always be installed into a dedicated virtual environment to isolate if from the local system. This ensures the integrity of Poetry and to avoid accidental upgrades or uninstallations


## Installation
